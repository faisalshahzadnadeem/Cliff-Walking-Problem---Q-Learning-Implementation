## 📋 Project Title
**Cliff Walking Problem - Q-Learning Implementation**

## 📝 Description
This project demonstrates how to solve the **Cliff Walking Problem** using the **Q-Learning algorithm**. The Cliff Walking environment is a grid-world problem provided by OpenAI Gym, where the agent must navigate from the starting point to the goal while avoiding falling into a cliff. The agent learns an optimal policy through trial and error by maximizing cumulative rewards.

## 🎯 Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Implement the **Q-Learning algorithm**.
- Understand the impact of hyperparameters like learning rate (α), discount factor (γ), and exploration rate (ϵ).
- Solve the Cliff Walking problem and analyze the agent's learning progress through reward trends.

## 📂 Files Included
- **cliff_walking_q_learning.py**: Python implementation of the Q-Learning algorithm for the Cliff Walking problem.
- **README.md**: This file containing project details and instructions.

## 🖥️ Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the code:

```bash
pip install gym numpy matplotlib
```

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the following command to execute the Q-Learning algorithm:

```bash
cliff_walking_q_learning.ipynb
```

## ⚙️ Q-Learning Algorithm Explained
The **Q-Learning** algorithm is a reinforcement learning technique that helps agents learn the best actions to take in an environment by maximizing cumulative rewards. The Q-value for a state-action pair is updated using the Bellman equation:

\[ Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left( R + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right) \]

Where:
- **s**: Current state
- **a**: Action taken
- **s'**: Next state
- **R**: Reward received
- **\( \alpha \)**: Learning rate
- **\( \gamma \)**: Discount factor

## 📊 Results
The code plots a graph showing the total rewards the agent received per episode. The learning curve demonstrates how the agent improves over time, learning to avoid the cliff and reach the goal efficiently.

## 🔧 Hyperparameters
- **Learning Rate (α)**: `0.1`
- **Discount Factor (γ)**: `0.99`
- **Exploration Rate (ϵ)**: `0.1`
- **Number of Episodes**: `500`

## 📈 Reward Trend Plot
The total rewards per episode are plotted to visualize the learning progress. The agent starts with low rewards but improves its performance over time as it learns to avoid the cliff and take shorter paths to the goal.

## 🛠️ Customization
You can adjust the following hyperparameters in the `cliff_walking_q_learning.py` file to observe their impact on the learning process:
- **alpha (Learning Rate)**
- **gamma (Discount Factor)**
- **epsilon (Exploration Rate)**
- **num_episodes (Number of Episodes)**
